# Job-Manager: A Claris FileMaker Utility

This tool balances simplicity with power. It is an outliner that has unlimited depth. Each leaf of the outline supports an information panel ( deadlines, active/blocked, progress, etc) and related worksheets. 

The aim of the tool is to keep track of work being done across multiple projects. It is not attempting to be a complete project management solution. It's more like a project manager's pocket book. I want enough information, but I don't want to have too much. 

It copies some of it's design from outliners. I like flexible solutions that don't force a particular paradigm onto the user. Jobs don't form neat patterns. This system allows a job to have as many, or few, components as you want. Each component is effectively a job in it's own right. It has all the same attributes ( deadlines, worksheets, etc ) and can contain as many, or few, sub-components as you want. 

## The way I use this tool
For each new job that I enter, I start to do some brain storming. What is involved? How many people? The components of a large job may be a mix of things, for example: 

1. Public: The web stuff
2. Client side: internals
3. Resources
4. Requirements

In this example, Resources may be a list of tools, or documents, or by-laws that we need to comply with. Requirements may be a long "blah" of notes from the planning session. The Public and Client Side components may itemise the functions that we are working on. Of course, each of those functions may contain their own components. And, again, the components can be a mix of mind-mapping, wire-framing, scrap-booking, note-taking, or forensic details.

Each leaf in all of this can contain unlimited work records, with their own notes. 

## Integration with other tools?

In fact, this tool was built because I work with a large, powerful, job management tool. The "Bug, Enhancement, Request" (BER) database is a behemoth. However, it has two missing pieces. I cannot split a job into component tasks, nor can I track work times. Job Manager does both of those things. To keep it in line with the BER, I've included a BER field which carries the BER Number.
